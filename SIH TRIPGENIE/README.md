* **🏨 TRIP STAYS** (Beach resorts, Himalayan villas & heritage homestays with amenity filters inspired by Airbnb).
* **🚕 TRIP RIDE** (Bike, Auto, Mini, Prime Sedan, and SUV rides with live driver matching simulation inspired by Uber).
* **🍜 TRIP FOOD** (Local restaurant food discovery, interactive menu add-to-cart & simulated delivery tracking inspired by Zomato).
* **🎬 TRIP ENTERTAINMENT** (IMAX movies, beach concerts, and cultural galas with interactive seat matrix selector inspired by BookMyShow).
* **🗺️ TRIP MAP & GPS** (Leaflet/OpenStreetMap interactive maps with browser Geolocation API, POI filters, and offline map pack download simulator).
* **📡 TRIP CONNECT** (Simulated Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Direct offline traveler mesh network inspired by Bridgefy).
* **🤖 GENIE AI COPILOT** (Interactive conversational travel assistant with 3-day itinerary generation, packing checklists, and budget advice).

## 💻 How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Safari).
2. Alternatively, run a simple local web server:
   ```powershell
   # In PowerShell inside the trip-genie directory:
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## 🛡️ Local Application & Integration Notes

The project includes a Python HTTP application server with a durable SQLite database in `data/tripgenie.sqlite3`. Wallet writes, bookings, and SOS telemetry are stored locally and served through REST endpoints. The current workspace does not contain payment, airline, hotel, dispatch, or AI provider credentials, so those external integrations must be configured before production launch. Never use the local wallet flow for real financial transactions or treat SOS telemetry as a replacement for emergency services.

Start the application with:

```powershell
python server.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000`. Keep provider secrets on the server in environment variables when adding real integrations.
